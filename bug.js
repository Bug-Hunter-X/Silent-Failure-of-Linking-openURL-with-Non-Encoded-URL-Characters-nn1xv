This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to open a URL in a user's default browser.  If the URL contains certain characters, specifically those that are not properly URL-encoded, the `Linking.openURL` function may fail silently or throw an unexpected error. This is particularly problematic because there isn't always a clear indication of failure in the Expo logs, making it difficult to debug.
